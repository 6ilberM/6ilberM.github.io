## Experimental Markdown Thing

But it is still quite the useful thing

```cs
using UnityEngine;

public class A_ThingDoing: MonoBehaviour {

    private void Start() {
        Debug.log("This is the first thing I ever do using the Code Block");
    }
}

```

quite something eh ?

Note: Remember you were setting up the Remark plugin

[Status Update](/StatusUpdate_1) this link will be the easiest way to link to another spot...
