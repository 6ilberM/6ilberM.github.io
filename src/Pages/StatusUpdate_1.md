Greetings fellow Human! Personally Iâ€™ve been doing pretty good, Iâ€™m healthy and
having fun doing all sortsof things. In other words iâ€™ve been procrastinating
quite a bit ....haha. It's been awhile since my last update so here is a sneak
peek at Î”Muse.

Currently I am stuck on the development for this game. It slowed down to a crawl
due to me being unable to think up level designs. I am absolutely terrible at
making levels ðŸ˜”. It's as if Iâ€™ve lost direction and after giving it some
thoughts I started to disagree with my riginal Dev Document for this game... I
kept adding and removing things and then I got stuck.

Maybe All I need is some direction or some input from family friends or even
strangers. Note: (I just seem to be really bad at making any levels.) Alsoâ€¦. The
previous couple of weeks I've felt a bit lost about what to do regarding my
career, so I spoke with various people and come to the conclusion that what I
must do first of all is to make an attractive portfolio as well as learn skills
required in my local market (Panama).

I'm going to make a great effort to change the state of my workflow! For that I
will be enumerating the things i want to do for the immediate future!
